# 2d-wave-equation-finite-difference-fantagasmora

This code is intended to aid anyone working on developing a numerical technique to solve the two dimensional wave equation using finite difference.  I have purposefully left parts out, so that some of the fun is still left.  Feel free to contact me with any questions. justinlboyer (at) gmail.com
